## Programming in R

You can develop R scripts using a GUI like RStudio[1] or you run your scripts using the command line.

### R in the commandline

On a Mac, I'd recommend installing R using homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install r
```

To check, if R is installed properly and which version you have use:

```bash
R --version
```

With

```bash
R --save < example.r
```

you run a script example.r which contains your R commands. The output pdf file will be generated in the folder you are currently in.
