## Getting started with Flask

To develop a Flask app, you need to get familar with HTML, CSS and Python. We have lectures, which cover that:

- HTML  
  https://github.com/WomensCodingCircle/HTML-CSS-West
  
- Python  
  https://github.com/WomensCodingCircle/CodingCirclePython  
  You need to know about loops, conditions, Python classes and dictionaries
  
Regarding Flask, it is helpful to get familiar with the following terms and concepts:

- Models  
  http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/models/
- Views  
  http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/views/
- Routes  
  http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#url-route-registrations
- Jinja2 Template Engine  
  http://jinja.pocoo.org

Knowing about MVC and E-R-Modeling helps to understand Flask views, models and how to the design the Model classes in models.py:
