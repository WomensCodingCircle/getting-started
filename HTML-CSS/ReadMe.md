# ReadMe file for HTML-CSS folder in Getting-Started

Hi, I am starting off this page, but please feel free to add your own suggestions, or edit and improve my suggestions. :-D  My name is Jennifer Yoon, and I am part of the Women's Coding Circle.

### Absolute Beginner

My suggestion for an absolute beginner in HTML and CSS is to go and watch several **YouTube.com** videos for beginners and to do several beginner tutorials on **w3schools.org**.

#### YouTube.com Beginner Videos.

[Search results for **HTML tutorial for beginners:**](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+tutorial+for+beginners)

Go to Youtube.com and type into its search box: "HTML for beginners," "HTML for absolute beginners,‚Äù or "CSS for beginners." Below are images of some of the videos that came up.  I recommend Traversy Media videos in general for webdev tutorials.  I learned a lot from his videos.  I think he is a good teacher, and explains stuff well in a low-key manner.  However, any of the other beginner videos will also have good information.  I recommend watching several different people, and watching your favorite ones many time.  On your 2nd or 3rd watching, pause the video and type or write the code out yourself.  Cover up 4 to 8 lines of code and see if you can reproduce it exactly.  Run it on your computer.  Did it work?  If not, can you spot the difference?  There may be more than one difference between what you typed and the video's code.  Cover the same code, and try reproducing it several more times until you feel comfortable.  Then move on to the next segment.  You don't have to do every segment on your first try.  Just do several that grabs your interest.  Later on, as you learn more, you may be interested in different parts of the video.

Also freely copy and paste code from StackOverflow.com, W3Schools.com, or anywhere else.  When you copy code, check your line indents, especially your first line.  Many editors mess this up.  All code at the same level needs to have the same or more indents.  Your code may not run properly if your indents do not line up.

Later on, I especially recommend Traversy Media's "crash courses" on CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox.  Several different YouTube video speakers  recommend using CSS Grid to layout webpages.  It seems to have become the dominant standard around spring of 2017.  Float is mainly for laying out an image with text that flows around the image.  CSS Grid also seems to have replaced frameworks, such as Bootstrap, for about half of YouTubers.  I agree that new websites should try to use CSS Grid first, before considering using a framework.  The main argument is that any website that hires a web developer would want custom design elements and custom user interfaces.  Otherwise, many free (or cheap) templates are available for download.  And usually those custom elements are not that many for the vast majority of websites.  Using a framework means overwriting all the customized sections of the website.  And the other parts of the framework are usually unused, which just slows page load times.  Popular frameworks, such as Bootstrap, are cached on edge servers, but they still incur a minor hit to speed.  This is more so for mobile phone users when they are on slower connections.

#### W3Schools.com tutorials for HTML and CSS

W3Schools.com has lots of tutorials for absolute beginners.  The site also has "Try It" button, that allows you to type HTML and CSS directly into the left box, and see the results on the right box from your browser.  You can type any HTML or CSS you want to try out, not just the ones the lesson is trying to teach you.  You can use it as a scratch pad to try out commands you are unfamiliar with.

### When You Are Ready for More

Welcome back after watching a bunch of YouTube videos and doing tutorials on w3schools!

The **starter.html**  file located in the HTML-CSS folder is there to help you start creating your own web pages.  It follows most style conventions recommended for HTML5 and CSS. First 7 lines or so is recommended for most html files.  They are machine read instructions for web browsers.  Starting with the <title> tag, you can customize your content.  I have used the best coding styles I found for HTML and CSS.  Using a good coding style is especially important once you start working on larger projects with a team.  It also makes it much easier for you to fix your own code later on, say six months later, when you have no idea why you wrote the code in that way. ;-)
  
#### Coding Styles used
  * Line indent:  4 spaces, no tabs.  I find this easier to read.  But more people recommend 2 spaces than 4 spaces.  Both 4 and 2 spaces are preferred over tabs.  (Also for multi-line codes, I increase indent for 2nd to last lines.  About half of others seem to do this.  I find this easier for spotting errors.)

  * Naming convention:  Almost everyone seem to use all-lowercase-hyphen for names.

  * Blank lines or white space:  I use one or more blank lines to separate sections.  This is more important for longer files.

  * Comments:  /* css comments */  and &lt;!-- html section comments --&gt;   
    * You can also use extra *********** or ------------ to create visual blocks in addition to comment tags.  On longer CSS files, two stars for first line followed by a full line of stars is recommended. Certain editors use /** as auto-help or code documentation.  
      /** This is an example of a CSS block comment.  
      ****************************************************** */

#### More to follow.

Also, I have added my own working website in the "Wiki" tab (see top menu).
