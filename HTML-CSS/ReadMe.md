# ReadMe file for HTML-CSS folder.

**starter.html**  file is an example file to help you get started creating your own web pages.  It follows most style conventions recommended for HTML5 and CSS. First 7 lines or so is recommended for most html files.  They are machine read instructions for web browsers.  Starting with <title> tag, you can customize your content.  I have used the best styles I have found recommended for HTML and CSS.  
  
#### Styles Used
  * line indent:  4 spaces, no tabs.  I find this easier to read and is consistent with Python style guide.  More people recommend 2 spaces than 4 spaces.  Both 4 and 2 spaces are preferred over tabs.  Nobody recommends tabs.

  * Naming convention:  Almost everyone seem to use all-lowercase-hyphen for names.

  * blank lines or white space:  I use one or more blank lines to separate section.  This is more important for longer files.

  * comments:  /* css comments */  and &lt;!-- html section comments --&gt;   You can also use extra *********** or ------------ to create visual blocks in addition to comment tags.

#### More to follow.

Also, I have added my own working example website in the "Wiki" tab (see top menu).
