## Introduction to LaTeX - the typesetting system

LaTeX allows you to create documents with the tools you use for programming as well, coding editors and the command line. You can create articles, presentation slides, papers and posters.

This folder contains some simple LaTeX documents. With

```bash
$ pdflatex feedback-form.tex
```

you can create a pdf file, which is a feedback form for our R class.
