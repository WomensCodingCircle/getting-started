## Introduction to LaTeX - the typesetting system

LaTeX [1] allows you to create documents with the tools you use for programming as well, coding editors and the command line. You can create articles, presentation slides, papers and posters.

This folder contains some simple LaTeX documents. With

```bash
$ pdflatex feedback-form.tex
```

you can create a pdf file, which is a feedback form for our R class.

### Development Environment
If you find it cumbersome to install a LaTeX IDE like TexLive [2] or MacTEX [3] try out online LaTeX environments like

https://www.overleaf.com/

Since it's a website, there is no need to install anything and you can use your google or twitter account to log in.

Also be aware that there is not only LaTeX, which is built on top of TeX [3], but also ConTeXt [4], XeTeX [5] or LuaTeX [6] so it might be a good idea to take a look and compare, which one
meets your needs best.
